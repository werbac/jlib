    "One of the oldest techniques in statistics is fitting _linear models_, which encompass various regression models and the models underlying the _analysis of variance_.  In the mid-20'th century the practice of fitting a response by least squares was extended to provide for models like _logistic regression_, for a binary response or for binomial response data, and _Poisson regression_, when the response is a count.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1972 Nelder and Wedderburn published a paper [\"Generalized Linear Models\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model) in J. Royal Statistical Society, Series A that provided a unifying framework for these and other models.  In these models a response, which can be binary or integer-valued or real-valued, is measured on $n$ occasions along with the values of _covariates_, which are also called \"predictor\" variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is a description of the probability distribution of the response given values of parameters.  From the probability model and the observed data, both the response and the covariates, we estimate values of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The values of the covariates and the model form determine a _model matrix_, $\\bf X$.  A _linear predictor_ is of the form $\\bf\\eta=X\\beta$, where $\\bf\\beta$ is the _coefficient vector_ to be estimated.  In some cases there is an additional _scale parameter_ to be estimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear regression\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability model for linear regression is\n",
    "$$ \\mathcal{Y}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(X\\beta,\\rm\\sigma^2\\bf I)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the _mean response_ is the linear predictor.  That is, $$\\rm E[\\mathcal{Y}]=\\bf\\mu=\\eta=\\bf X\\beta$$\n",
    "and the distribution of the response is multivariate normal (or Gaussian) with scale parameter, $\\sigma$.  Furthermore, the responses are independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A link function\n",
    "\n",
    "One characteristic of a linear predictor is that its range is a complete linear subspace of the $n$-dimensional response space.  For a normal distribution there are no constraints on the expected response, which makes it meaningful for us to set $\\bf\\mu=\\eta$.  For other distributions the range of the expected response is constrained.  For a Bernoulli distribution we have $0\\le\\mu_i\\le1,i=1,\\dots,n$ and for a Poisson we have $0<\\mu_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomodate these constraints we map the linear predictor values, $\\eta_i$, to the expected responses, $\\mu_i$, in such a way that the constraints hold.  For historical reasons it is the inverse map, $g:\\mu_i\\rightarrow\\eta_i$, that is called the _link function_.  In practice we use the inverse link function, $g^{-1}:\\eta_i\\rightarrow\\mu_i$ more than we use the link.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Canonical link functions\n",
    "\n",
    "If all we require in a link function is that the range of the inverse link is the appropriate interval for the expected value, i.e. $[0,1]$ for Bernoulli responses and $(0,\\infty)$ for Poisson responses, then we have a very wide range of functions to choose from.  However, Nelder and Wedderburn showed that a _canonical link function_ can be derived from the probability mass function or probability density function for distributions that are in the [exponential family](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_family).  The derivation is not particularly difficult but we won't include it here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common examples of canonical link functions are:\n",
    "- the _logit_ or \"log odds\" link for the Bernoulli distribution\n",
    "$$g(\\mu)=\\log\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{1-\\mu}\\right),\\quad0<\\mu<1$$\n",
    "- the _log_ link for the Poisson distribution\n",
    "$$g(\\mu)=\\log(\\mu),\\quad0<\\mu$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, [logistic regression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression) is named after the inverse link function\n",
    "$$g^{-1}(\\eta)=\\frac{1}{1+\\exp(-\\eta)}$$\n",
    "which is called the logistic function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relating the variance to the mean\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution has many, many interesting properties, one of which is that the location (mean) and spread (standard deviation) can be controlled separately.  This is not true for most distributions.  For many distributions like the Bernoulli or the Poisson the variance or standard deviation is a function of the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specification of a GLM\n",
    "\n",
    "To specify a generalized linear model we must provide\n",
    "- the observed responses, $\\bf y$\n",
    "- the model matrix, $\\bf X$, derived from the values of the covariates\n",
    "- the link function\n",
    "- the distribution type of the response\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike linear least squares there is no direct method for evaluating parameter estimates, such as the maximum likelihood estimates (mle's), in a GLM.  We must use iterative methods.  Below we describe the _iteratively reweighted least squares_ (IRLS) algorithm for determining the mle's."
